# art-fusion-gallery

I want to create a website for my artwork, which is mainly oil paintings that focuses on combining science and art. This website should have an about me page that describes my background and what my art is about. It should also display all my paintings in a clean, easy-to-navigate way. I also want people who click on the art piece be able to buy the perspective art print on this website. Once you click into the art piece that attracts your attention, there're various pictures/photographs of the artwork, a short description, and maybe even some videos that shows the in-progress scenes of me painting it. I want this website to look professional, classy, and high-end.
